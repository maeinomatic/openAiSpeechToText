# openAiSpeechToText
record audio with the microphone and get a transcription from openai

**before you begin:** Add a text file "openai_api_key.txt" to the scripts folder and paste your openai api key into it.

*Alternatively, if you have the api key already in your environment variables you can change line 19 to:*

```openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")```

**You need an openai account to use this.**
